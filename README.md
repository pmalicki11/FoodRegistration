  This app will help you to register of what you eat and drink.
  You can choose products from existing product base or put some of yours too.
  The idea is to collect products by linking them to account which will allow the app to generate report of recurring ingredients.
  It is useful for those who have allergy but have no idea what is the cause.
  By adding products that potentially caused allergy reaction it is easy to find an ingrediens which to avoid.

  It is plenty of space to develop the app by adding new features or improve its interface.
  I have listed some of them on the <a href="https://github.com/pmalicki11/FoodRegistration/issues">Issues</a> list.

  Developing this app has helped me to learn and understand MVC pattern and PHP itself.
  The inspiration for creating this was <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFPkAJFH7I0keB1qpWk5qVVUYdNLTEUs3">Curtis Parham's free course on YouTube</a>.
  Thanks man! You're doing the great job!
